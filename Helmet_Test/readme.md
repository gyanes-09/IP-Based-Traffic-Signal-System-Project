The Apple M3 chip has a built-in GPU and a Neural Engine optimized for ML workloads. To leverage the M3 GPU for your project, you need to make the following changes:

1. Use Apple's Metal Backend for PyTorch
Since YOLO and EasyOCR rely on PyTorch, you need to install the Metal-optimized version of PyTorch:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
Then, in your script, replace gpu=False with gpu=True for EasyOCR:

python
Copy
Edit
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], gpu=True)
2. Enable YOLOv8 to Use MPS (Apple GPU)
Modify your YOLO model loading to explicitly set it to use mps (Metal Performance Shaders):

python
Copy
Edit
import torch

device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")

coco_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt').to(device)
license_plate_detector = YOLO('./models/license_plate_detector.pt').to(device)
3. Ensure NumPy & OpenCV Are Optimized
Mac M3 works well with numpy and opencv, but make sure they are installed properly:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy opencv-python-headless
4. Enable Apple’s Accelerate Framework for NumPy
Set an environment variable to use Apple’s optimized BLAS/LAPACK:

bash
Copy
Edit
export MKL_SERVICE_FORCE_INTEL=0
5. Enable Metal Acceleration in OpenCV (Optional)
If OpenCV is used for image processing, enable Metal acceleration:

python
Copy
Edit
cv2.setUseOptimized(True)
cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(True)
6. Check Performance
Run this command to ensure PyTorch recognizes your M3 GPU:

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())  # Should return True

6. Traffic Violations Detection
Triple Riding Detection: Identify if more than two people are on a bike.
Wrong Way Driving: Detect vehicles moving against traffic.
Signal Jumping: Check if vehicles cross intersections when the signal is red.

7. Vehicle & Crime Monitoring
Stolen Vehicle Detection: Cross-check detected license plates with a police database (MongoDB).
Hit and Run Detection: Detect accidents and identify fleeing vehicles.
No Seatbelt Detection: Expand detection for cars to check seatbelt use.


8. Pedestrian & Crowd Safety
Crowd Monitoring: Detect unusually large gatherings that could indicate protests or riots.
Loitering Detection: Identify people staying in restricted areas for extended periods.
Falling Person Detection: Identify pedestrians who have fallen and may need medical help.
